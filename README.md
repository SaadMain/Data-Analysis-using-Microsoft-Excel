# Data-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Excel
## Let you learn how to use MS Excel for Data Analysis

The first file with the title 'sales_data_analysis' is the original file. 
The file 'sales_data_analyzed' is analyzed, which presents the overall view of this project. 

In this project, I have done the following:
1. Data sorting (to re-arrange the data)
2. Data Filtering (to quickly obtain specific information in data)
3. Data Mining (where to take available data and create or add new data from it)
4. IF function
6. VLOOKUP function (to relate tables located in different sheets and searching for particular information)
7. Pivot table (to analyze or summarize the data by seeing or comparing it)
